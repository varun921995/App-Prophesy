# App-Prophesy

  

App-Prophecy helps a developer to predict how successful their application will be in terms of Rating and the number of installations. Also, it will also give the developer useful suggestions on how they can vary the size and price of the application in order to improve the Rating or Installation of their application.

The visualisations can further help the developer to understand the trends for applications in different categories using the scatter plot. Further, App-Prophecy also provides a word cloud that can help developer in giving a name to their application. The Sunburst chart gives the insights of the dataset used in this project.
